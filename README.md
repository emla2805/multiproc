# Request parallelism experiment

An attempt at making multithreaded requests to various free API's 
using Python packages `multiprocessing` and [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org). Inspiration is taken from [here](https://medium.com/building-things-on-the-internet/40e9b2b36148).

## API's used
For weather data [this API](http://openweathermap.org/API) was used, and for ip data [this one](http://www.telize.com). Both are free to use.
